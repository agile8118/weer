# URL Shortener with Cpeak

Weer will be the **first real-world, production-grade complex** project built with Cpeak.

---

### Project Goal

The aim of this project is to be one of the best professional URL shortener apps on the internet, capable of handling thousands of requests per second. The **Cpeak framework** is being developed **in parallel** with this project. You can check out this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCiGw8i6NhvqsA-ZZcChJ0kaHZ3hcIVdY) to follow Cpeak's development and see what it takes to build a real-world Node.js framework that powers a complex project.

### Why Weer?

Although a URL shortener app might sound like a simple project, you'll be surprised to see the amount of work that we need to put into it, especially since we are also developing our own zero-dependency Node.js framework from scratch. Again, we don't want to just create a URL shortener app, we want to create THE BEST one, an app that would be your or any other person's first choice to use in their work or presentations when there is a need to share a URL with others quickly. The amount of work we need to do regarding error handling, robustness, performance and security might be shocking to some, but that's what it takes to build a high-quality product.

We will have hackers constantly attacking the application and finding security issues, and as we fix them, there are going to be lectures on the security concepts in the Security section of the [Understanding Node.js: Core Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-nodejs-core-concepts/?referralCode=0BC21AC4DD6958AE6A95) course.

### Follow the Journey

The development of the project will take months to complete. So follow the project for an interesting journey ahead!

#### Notes

This project will be completely open-source, and documentation on setting up the project, source code structure, running tests, contribution, deployment, etc., will be added in the future. Thank you for your interest!
